The first thing that comes to my mind is the total volume of passengers for domestic and international type. But also, we can investigate this issue for each year, which will not be a mistake and will make sense. Therefore, we will draw conclusions for each year, and in general for the period from 2005 to 2017.\n\nFor this question, we need the column \"geo_summary\" which has the value Domestic and International for each airline, which shows whether it was a flight within the same country or between different countries. Also, for more detailed information, we need a column with the date period \"activity_period\", which shows in which month it was made.\n\nFirst, let's build a pie chart that will show information for each type of flight to see the difference between them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#getting passengers summary and groping by geo_summary\ndf_pie_chart_data <- df %>%\n    drop_na() %>%\n    group_by(geo_summary) %>%\n    summarise(adjusted_passenger_count = sum(adjusted_passenger_count))\n\ndf_pie_chart_data\n\npiepercent<- round(100*df_pie_chart_data$adjusted_passenger_count/sum(df_pie_chart_data$adjusted_passenger_count), 1)\n\n#creating pie chart\npie(df_pie_chart_data$adjusted_passenger_count, labels=paste(df_pie_chart_data$geo_summary, \"(\" , piepercent, \"%)\", sep=\"\"), \n    main = \"Domestic vs International in general(by passengers)\", \n    col = rainbow(length(df_pie_chart_data$geo_summary)))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Therefore, we can see a huge advantage of domestic flights over international.

This is not very good, because taking into account this, we can draw wrong conclusions. Therefore, you need to keep this in mind.\n\nFrom these two charts, you can be sure that domestic flights are much more popular than international.\n\n\n<a id='productive-year'></a>\n### The most productive year\n\nSo, now, let's take a closer look at the statistics for each year. It is necessary to investigate which year was the most profitable and the most relevant in terms of passenger traffic, and which was vice versa.\n\nFirst of all, let's examine how many entries we have in the table for each year.

We can see that every year the number of passengers and flights is growing, which is logical. But, the question is why 2016 has the least number of passengers? It depends on the fact that it has the least records. Since I have no contact with the person who created this database, I can conclude that some data were simply not added. Let's try to find out.\n\n> SELECT Distinct Month\nFROM \n  `air_traffic_passenger.passenger_traffic`\nwhere Year = 2016\n\nIf we make such a query to the DB, in my case it was bigQuery, we can see that result will be [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\"]. If we will do the same for 2015 result is all 12 month in year. So, we found a problem, the data for 2016 were taken only for the first 3 months, which does not allow to fully assess and draw conclusions for 2016.\n\nNow let's turn to the year in which the passenger traffic was the lowest. Let's check whether all months were included in 2005. Make the same SQL query, but now where = 2005. \n\n> SELECT Distinct Month\nFROM \n  `air_traffic_passenger.passenger_traffic`\nwhere Year = 2005\n\nWe received data only for [\"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"]. So, if we do not take this into account, 2005 is the smallest year in terms of passenger traffic and if we do the analysis. But if we look only at the data, then 2005 will be rejected and our option will be 2006 for which data is available for all 12 months.\n\n<a id='ticket-cost'></a>\n\n\n### Cheap ticket or expensive?\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's consider one more question.

But we do not know for sure which positions Other includes.\n\n<a id='conclusions'></a>\n\n# Conclusions\n\n\nThis analysis aimed to analyze the flight database from 2005 to 2016, which contains more than 15 thousand records.\n\nThis dashboard was intended to explore the database in a certain way, to consider in more detail the flights of people, passenger traffic and to draw certain conclusions based on this.\n\nI would also like to warn that it is impossible to assert the reliability of the statements provided and the statistical validity of the data, but the conclusions obtained as a result of this analysis can be the basis for an in-depth study of these issues.\n\n### Dataset and structure\n\nThe dataset consists of 17 columns and more than 15 thousand records. \n* it has a lot of information, namely: information about the year and month traffic, terminals, regions, number of passengers and more \n* the data was partially cleaned, but not completely, some columns had the wrong type \n* there is also a lot of lost data, for example for 2005 and 2016, which include several months, which is not good for analysis\n* there is not enough information to study certain problems, for example, pricing policy\n\n### Price Category Code\n\nFor this column we have only 2 values *other/low fare*, which did not allow us to investigate the price category in more detail. Some conclusions can be made incorrectly, so you need to take this into account.\n\n### GEO Region\n\nThe data is not entered in the correct format because it does not meet the standards. That is, the computer cannot take and break them into certain categories, for example, for the US or America, Mexico everything works well, but for Europe and Asia the situation is more complicated.\n\n### Domestic vs International\n\nWhile researching this issue, I found some problems with the table. But if we summarize, it turned out that people fly more within the country, such 77 percent, which is 339042566 people. For International the rest, that is 23 percent and 101093590 people. This is a very big difference, but it is logical that people travel more within the country than outside it.\n\n### The most productive year\n\nThis issue is not unambiguous, as the database does not fully take into account the years 2005, 2016. If we make certain predictions, we can say that 2016 would have the highest number of arrivals compared to the others. But if we do not take this into account, the best year was 2015, which is the leader. \nIf we talk about the worst year, the situation is the same as with the best, we do not have complete information for 2005, so we can not be sure. But if we put this aside, then yes, 2005 is the worst year in terms of passenger traffic.\n\n### Low Fare or Other?\n\nYes, it looks strange, low price and so on. What else? It is not clear, because other can contain a lot of different price categories. For this column it would be cool to create more useful information, to keep it in a slightly different form. But if we talk about what we have, the situation is that for domestic flights people choose low price, and for long-distance flights - other. This may be due to the fact that long-distance flights are simply more expensive than flights between neighboring cities. Also, do not forget that the flight between neighboring cities can be from one country to another, it is not expensive, and the parameter is not domestic but international. \nSpeaking about this table, there are more people who chose an expensive price tag than people who chose an expensive price tag.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Additional Content\n\nAlso, you can check out the Tableau dashboard I created for this project.
